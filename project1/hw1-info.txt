Plots & Conclusions:
Timespan of New York's records of PM2.5 pollutants is 2000-2016.

1.Average Concentration of Various PM2.5 Pollutants in NYC (2000-2016)
Conclusion:The amount of PM2.5 pollutants have been gradually decreasing in New York over the years.

2.Average Concentration of Various PM2.5 Pollutants in US (1990-2017)
Conclusion:Countrywide, the amount of PM2.5 pollutants keep floating and remain the same level from 1990.

3.Overall Concentration of PM2.5 Pollutants in US vs NYC (2000-2016)
Conclusion:Although the amount PM2.5 pollutants in New York have been decreasing, it is still significantly larger than countrywide average, which means air pollution is still relatively severe in New York than in most other cities in US. However, the situation are getting better.

4.Piechart: Proportion of PM2.5 Pollutants in New York in 2016

Procedures:
1.Log in to mariaDB on IBM cloud. In terminal execute sql file:
	source /home/2018/spring/nyu/6513/xb306/HW1/hw1-sql.sql
This will create a table named pollutants in database xb306 and import all the data in the CSV file.
As an alternative.
2.In terminal execute
	Rscript /home/2018/spring/nyu/6513/xb306/HW1/hw1-r.R
This will run all the queries and output 4 plots:
	HW1_plot1_xb306.png, HW1_plot2_xb306.png, 
	HW1_plot3_xb306.png, HW1_plot4_xb306.png
These plots will be saved in the current directory. I have also uploaded the plots in 
	/home/2018/spring/nyu/6513/xb306/HW1/plots/
